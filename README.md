# Wildfire_Prediction_with_Satellite_Images
This project aims to explore satellite image dataset in order to create a CNN model for wildfire prediction problem. There are some ideas to integrate image segmentation and augmentation models.

The dataset was taken from this Kaggle repository: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelghaniaaba/wildfire-prediction-dataset. Satellite images of areas that previously experienced wildfires in Canada.
